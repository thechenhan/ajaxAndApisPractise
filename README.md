# ajaxAndApisPractise
I practise to use some APIs and jQuery AJAX function. The user can type into the address. And the app will call the Google Street view Api to load the background img. And the news related to the city will show up by calling the New Yorks Times API. And wikipedia related to the city will also show up by calling the wikiMedia search API.

The core techniques: jQuery, AJAX, JSON, API.

Futureï¼š If I still have time, I will integrate Bootstap to make the page nice.
